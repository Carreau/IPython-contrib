IPython-contrib
===============

IPython-contrib is an unofficial organisation that try to regroup project that
are made to be used with IPython. Please ask if you want to add a project !

Contribute
==========

You have a new project that extend IPython or a new magic ? Pleas ask we can
create a repository to host your code and give you write access on it. 

You have seen another project that should be mention here, tell us in the issue
list.

Goal
====

We want to provide a better visibility of project that extend IPython by
regrouping them under the same organisation. Project creator will still keep
full control of their project but can easyli delegate work thanks to github
"teams".

We do not require the same quality of code that is required to be part of the
main IPython repository, but we do our best to came as close as possible from
it.

This Repo
=========

This repo is the master repo to track issues on the scale of the organisation,
Each project can have it's own repository under the organisation with custom
rights and sub-group of people that can push / pull etc...

We will probably also get a Misc repository that store configuration and code
snippets that are below 50 lines or for which a full repository is overkill.
